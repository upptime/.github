# Contributing Guidelines

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make
* Problems show where this project is lacking
* With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience

Thank you for creating them!

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository. When deciding whether to merge a pull request, the following factors are considered:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.


### Is it of good quality

* There are no spelling mistakes
* It reads well
* Follows grammatical best-practices

### Does it follow the Code of Conduct

Make sure that you follow the Code of Conduct, available at https://github.com/stethoscope-js/.github.
